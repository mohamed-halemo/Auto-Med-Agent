Title: The epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak

Abstract:
In late 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, China, and has since led to a global pandemic. This review highlights the epidemiology, clinical features, transmission, and pathogenesis of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via ACE2 receptors and spreads rapidly, especially in dense populations. Symptoms range from mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia. Understanding virus-host interactions and immune responses remains critical for effective treatment and vaccine design.
